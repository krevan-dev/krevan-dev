Welcome to my GitHub. I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer. I call myself a hacker more than anything. I don't officially know any coding languages. Instead, I know enough to attempt to understand what I am reading, but at the current time, I have no idea how to start or how to build the majority of what I see. Instead I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many, MANY prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well.

- I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JS. 
- 8 year United States Army Veteran.
- 6 year Correctional Officer.
- Lifelong Video Game and Movie Fan.
- Favorite Movie is Back to the Future.
- Favorite Music Genre is Synthwave (for them late night sessions in VSCode or Atom)
